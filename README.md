## AWS IAM Permission Boundary Workshop

In this self-guided workshop, you will construct a walled garden utilizing
[IAM permission boundaries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html)
to enable multiple teams to operate with administrative privileges within a shared AWS account.

The same approach can be applied for isolating multiple CI/CD pipelines deploying into the one AWS account.
